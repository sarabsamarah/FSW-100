<h4>Hi my name is Sarab Samarah and I am here for your vision.</h4>

<p>Ok, so yes I am a consultant, but the not the kind you're used to.  I am not here to pitch you the methodology that is going to work for everyone because I created it.  I am here to pitch you to <span style="color:darkslateblue;font-weight:bolder">YOU!</span>  I am here to visualize your purpose in your business and make it happen! Sure, you can go to a convention, hire a consulting group that has been prospecting you through purchased lists, sending you the same template email they send to everyone every week hoping someone is going to bite, but you're here, you found me.  You ever heard the saying: "Work with what you got."?  I believe in that, I am not the last resort I am the facelift, retouch, refurbish, we're ready to go to the next level plan.  Let's see whats working, build on that and <span>Get It!</span> What good is a carefully curated plan without a check in and follow up?  We need to tweak things, every well oiled machine needs tweaks and tune ups.</p>
