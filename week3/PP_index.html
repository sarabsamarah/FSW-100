            <h3>Inversions</h3>
            <p>Inversions are a set of poses designed reset and reinvigorate the body and mind.  Gravity keeps the body moving from up to down, inverting the body gives it a chance to pause and rest, reset.</p>

            <h5>Balancing and Inversions</h5>
            <p>Poses that are meant to challenge the inner core and bhandas, or if you have ever heard of "flying" in yoga. Elevating the hips above the heart will present the "flying" feeling n yoga, balancing is also a way to connect the core and bhandas in sync giving the ability to lift and balance.  There is an inversion element as well with poses like: headstand, handstand, shoulder stand, and scorpion.</p>
